PROJECT TITLE:- "NOVEL GENETIC PREDICTOR"

TEAM DETAIL;
TEAM NAME:- MUST ORBITERS
TEAM MEMBERS:- 1)AYUSH KUMAR PARGANIHA(LEAD),2)SHEIKH ABDUL ZEESHAN,3)ARBAB RIFFAT SHAHNWAZ,4)ANSH MAHAJAN

ðŸ”¹ Problem

1)Rare genetic disorders are hard to diagnose in children.
2)Symptoms often overlap â†’ doctors struggle to identify correctly.
3)Diagnosis delays can take years, leading to worse outcomes.
4)Current tools are either too general or not pediatric-focused.

ðŸ”¹ Solution (NGP â€“ Novel Genetic Predictor)

1)A web app that predicts possible rare genetic disorders in children under 18.
2)Doctors enter patient details: demographics, symptoms, genetic info, lab results.
3)AI model (Reinforcement Learning: DQN, PPO, Actor-Critic) predicts disorders.
4)Provides multiple possible diagnoses + personalized treatment suggestions.

INSTALLATION AND USAGE;

1)CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ,EX COMMAND:-python -m venv Venv

2)ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMEN,EX COMMAND:- .venv\Scripts\activate

3)IF THERE ALREADY IS A "venv" folder delete it first than proceed with above 2 steps.

4)RUN COMMAND:- python -m streamlit run app.py --server.port 8507

5)OUR APP WILL BE RUNNING ON A LOCAL HOST(PLEASE CHECK).

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements

1)Larger Dataset Integration â€“ Training the model with global pediatric genetic datasets for higher accuracy and broader coverage of rare disorders.

2)Larger Dataset Integration â€“ Training the model with global pediatric genetic datasets for higher accuracy and broader coverage of rare disorders.

3)The page of "RL training" doesn't work for now,it's just a design or you can say layout(it does't do anything),Our aim is to make it work and provide personaized model training.
