## Introduction

This feature adds an emergency alert system to the Novel Genetic Predictor (NGP) application that allows healthcare professionals to quickly send SMS alerts to designated phone numbers when critical situations arise during patient diagnosis. The system will integrate with Twilio SMS service to provide reliable emergency notifications with patient context and urgency levels.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the user selects an urgency level and confirms THEN the system SHALL send an SMS message to the configured phone number within 10 seconds
3. WHEN the SMS is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with timestamp
4. IF the SMS fails to send THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide retry options
5. WHEN an emergency alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the event with patient case ID, timestamp, and urgency level

### Requirement 2

4. WHEN the administrator tests the configuration THEN the system SHALL send a test SMS and report success/failure
5. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the emergency SMS to include relevant patient information and diagnosis context, so that the emergency contact receives actionable information about the critical case.

4. WHEN the urgency level is HIGH THEN the SMS SHALL include "URGENT" prefix and callback instructions
5. WHEN the message exceeds SMS length limits THEN the system SHALL truncate appropriately while preserving critical information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to see the emergency button prominently displayed during patient diagnosis, so that I can quickly access emergency alerts when needed without navigating away from the current patient case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Patient Diagnosis tab THEN the emergency button SHALL be visible and easily accessible
2. WHEN no patient data is entered THEN the emergency button SHALL be disabled with tooltip explanation
3. WHEN patient data is present THEN the emergency button SHALL be enabled and highlighted in red
